"Fighting power, three dan!"

Looking at the five big characters shining and even a little dazzling on the test magic stone stele, the young man's face was expressionless, there was a touch of self-mockery at the corner of his lips, and the clenched palm was deeply pierced into the palm because of his strength, causing slightly sharp nails to pierce deeply into the palm, bringing bursts of heart-piercing pain...

"Xiao Yan, the power of fighting, three stages! Level: Low! Next to the Magic Stone Stele, a middle-aged man glanced at the information displayed on the stele and announced it indifferently...

As soon as the middle-aged man blurted out, it was no accident that a mocking commotion was brought in the crowded square.

"Three paragraphs? Hehe, sure enough, as I expected, this "genius" is still in place this year! "

"Hey, this waste really disgraces the family's face. "

"If it weren't for the fact that the patriarch was his father, this kind of waste would have been driven out of the family long ago and left to fend for itself, and there would be no chance to stay in the family for nothing."

"Alas, how did the genius boy who was known in Wutan City in the past become like this now?"

"Who knows, maybe you did something wrong and provoked the wrath of the gods..."
